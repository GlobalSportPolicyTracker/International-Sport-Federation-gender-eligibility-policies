# The Dataset #

To help organisations and sport federations better understand what other sports around them are doing, we have created a dataset of the policies regarding participation of transgender and non-binary athletes, as well as athletes with differences of sexual developement (DSDs). We have also collected data on whether each sport is condered to be 'gender affected', and whether the sport federation requires any form of gender/sex testing in order to participate in some or all of their events for a particular gender. 

Full codebook and interpretation guide for each of the indicators can be found [here](codebook_and_documentation.md)

This data is **NOT** meant to be used or considered as a statement on whether or not certain individuals should participate in sport - it has been developed to help aid and support the difficult conversations that are happening within sporting organsiations around the world, and to allow for systematic and consistent comparison of international sport federation policies. 

This dataset will expand as we add more International Sport Federations, and also the regulations of large international multisport organisation (i.e., IOC, Commonwealth Games Federation, etc)

| TP1 | TP1_transwomen | Existence of a policy on transgender women participation in International Sport Federation (IF) | Ordinal scale | 0- NO policy<br>1- NO policy, IF leans towards inclusion<br>2- YES, specific policies for certain events/disciplines/categories within IF<br>3- YES, general policy applicable to all events/disciplines/categories within IF |
| | | Interpretation of TP1: 0 – NO policy: this means that there was no policy to be found, or the IF clearly stated that they do not have a policy at this point in time on transgender women participating in the sports they govern. 1 – NO policy, IF leans towards inclusion: this means that either there was no specific gender eligibility policy found, but there was a very clear policy on inclusion and equal treatment of all athletes regardless of sex or gender identity when it comes to participation, AND/OR it could mean that the IF states that all individuals are able to participate in the gender they identify with AND/OR it could mean that the sport also has clear portrayal guidelines implying inclusion and non-discrimination (please check notes for more details). 2 – YES, Specific policies for certain events/disciplines/categories within IF: this means that the IF only has a policy regarding specific events/disciplines/categories within the sport that the IF is responsible for. For example, The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) allows transgender women to compete in all events except for those designated as "strength events" and has distinct eligibility criteria for those events. 3 – YES, general policy applicable to all events/disciplines/categories within IF: this means that that the IF has a singular policy and eligibility criteria for all transgender women in order to participate in any event/discipline/category that they govern. | | |

| | | Interpretation of TP2: 0 – NO policy: this means that there was no policy to be found, or the IF clearly stated that they do not have a policy at this point in time on transgender men participating in the sports they govern. 1 – NO policy, IF leans towards inclusion: this means that either there was no specific gender eligibility policy found, but there was a very clear policy on inclusion and equal treatment of all athletes regardless of sex or gender identity when it comes to participation, AND/OR it could mean that the IF states that all individuals are able to participate in the gender they identify with AND/OR it could mean that the sport also has clear portrayal guidelines implying inclusion and non-discrimination (please check notes for more details). 2 – YES, Specific policies for certain events/disciplines/categories within IF: this means that the IF only has a policy regarding specific events/disciplines/categories within the sport that the IF is responsible for. For example, World Aquatics (WAQU) allows transgender male athletes to compete in all World Aquatics competitions, however in the disciplines of water polo and high diving such athletes are required to provide an 'assumption of risk' form as an extra eligibility requirement. 3 – YES, general policy applicable to all events/disciplines/categories within IF: this means that that the IF has a singular policy and eligibility criteria for all transgender men in order to participate in any event/discipline/category that they govern. | | |

| | | Interpretation of TP3: 0 – NO policy: this means that there was no policy to be found, or the IF clearly stated that they do not have a policy at this point in time on non-binary athletes participating in the sports they govern. 1 – NO policy, IF leans towards inclusion: this means that either there was no specific gender eligibility policy found, but there was a very clear policy on inclusion and equal treatment of all athletes regardless of sex or gender identity when it comes to participation, AND/OR it could mean that the IF states that all individuals are able to participate in the gender they identify with AND/OR it could mean that the sport also has clear portrayal guidelines implying inclusion and non-discrimination (please check notes for more details). 2 – YES, Specific policies for certain events/disciplines/categories within IF: this means that the IF only has a policy regarding specific events/disciplines/categories within the sport that the IF is responsible for. For example, World Flying Disc Federation (WFDF) has differing eligibility requirements for transgender and non-binary athletes depending on the age category in which the athlete is attempting to participate in. 3 – YES, general policy applicable to all events/disciplines/categories within IF: this means that that the IF has a singular policy and eligibility criteria for all non-binary athletes in order to participate in any event/discipline/category that they govern. | | |
| TP4 | TP4_diffsexdevel | Existence of a policy on intersex individuals and individuals with a difference of sexual development participation in International Sport Federation (IF) | Ordinal scale | 0- NO policy<br>1- NO policy, IF leans towards inclusion<br>2- YES, specific policies for certain events/disciplines/categories within IF<br>3- YES, general policy applicable to all events/disciplines/categories within IF |
| | | Interpretation of TP4: 0 – NO policy: this means that there was no policy to be found, or the IF clearly stated that they do not have a policy at this point in time on intersex athletes or those with a DSD participating in the sports they govern. 1 – NO policy, IF leans towards inclusion: this means that either there was no specific gender eligibility policy found, but there was a very clear policy on inclusion and equal treatment of all athletes regardless of sex or gender identity or DSD when it comes to participation, AND/OR it could mean that the IF states that all individuals are able to participate in the gender they identify with AND/OR it could mean that the sport also has clear portrayal guidelines implying inclusion and non-discrimination (please check notes for more details). 2 – YES, Specific policies for certain events/disciplines/categories within IF: this means that the IF only has a policy regarding specific events/disciplines/categories within the sport that the IF is responsible for. For example, World Athletics (WATH) has an extensive policy regarding the participation of intersex athletes and athletes with a DSD, and the regulations for events such as the women's 400m differ from the eligibility requirements for other women's events. 3 – YES, general policy applicable to all events/disciplines/categories within IF: this means that that the IF has a singular policy and eligibility criteria for all intersex athletes or those with a DSD in order to participate in any event/discipline/category that they govern. | | |
| MGT1 | MGT1_mandatorytesting | Existence of a policy on mandatory gender/sex testing of individuals for participation in International Sport Federation (IF) | Ordinal scale | 0- NO policy<br>1- YES, testing required under request or suspicion<br>2- YES, mandatory testing of women/female categories only<br>3- YES, mandatory testing of both men and women |
| | | Interpretation of MGT1: 0 – NO policy: this means that there was either no policy to be found, or the IF clearly states somewhere that there is no mandatory gender testing – either through genetic screening or physical examination – for events sanctioned by the IF. 1 – YES, testing required under request or suspicion: this means that the IF states (usually in their gender eligibility policy) that if an individual athlete is suspected to not meet the gender eligibility conditions for their sport/event/discipline/category, requests for gender verification (usually genetic screening or physical examination) can be made. For example, Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) states that if there is a valid or reasonable reason to believe that the gender of a participant does not align to their stated gender, a request for gender verification can be made – subject to approval by FIFA. 2 – YES, mandatory test of women/female categories only: this means that the IF requires all athletes who wish to participate in the women/female category of sport to undergo genetic screening (usually SRY gene test) and/or physical examination in order to determine their biological sex. Those who wish to participate in the women/female category of their sport/event/discipline must be shown to be biologically female at birth. For example, World Athletics (WATH) requires all athletes who wish to participate in the female category at world ranking competitions to undergo a once-in-a-lifetime test for the SRY gene to show that they were biologically female at birth. 3 – YES, mandatory testing of both men and women: this means that the IF requires ALL athletes to undergo gender verification screening (either by genetic screening and/or physical examination) in order to ensure that individuals only participate in the gender/sex category of which they were born for their sport/event/discipline. For example, World Boxing (WB) states that to be eligible for the men's category of competition, a competitor must be born male, and to be eligible for the women's category of competition, a competitor must be born female. All athletes over the age of 18 years are required to have their sex certified (once-in-a-lifetime) by a PCR or equivalent test, and to provide certification to World Boxing to be eligible for competition. | | |
| GA1 | GA1_genderaffected | Does the International Sport Federation (IF) consider the sport to be 'gender affected' | Ordinal scale | 0- NO, or no indication<br>1- Possibly gender affected<br>2- YES, for some events/disciplines/categories<br>3- YES, general |
| | | Interpretation of GA1: 0 – NO, or no indication: this means that the IF either a.) does not believe that gender/sex has a detrimental impact/effect on fair and safe participation of men and women in the same sport, OR b.) does not state in their participation guidelines/gender eligibility policy, or gives no indication in any documentation as to whether they consider their sport to be 'gender affected' [where the physical strength, stamina or physique of average persons of one gender would put them at a disadvantage (in fairness and/or safety) to average persons of another gender]. 1 – Possibly gender affected: this means that the IF does not explicitly state in their participation guidelines or gender eligibility policies that their sport is gender affected, but they either use language that suggests it is, or they have clear gender eligibility rules that use rationale and imply that their sport is gender affected. For example, World Sailing (WS) does not explicitly state that sailing is a gender affected sport, but the rationale in their policy on transgender participation indicates that it has been developed to ensure 'safety and fairness' and not to undermine World Sailing's goals for the female category. 2 – YES, for some events/disciplines/categories: this means that the IF considers the events/disciplines/categories of the sports they govern to differ as to whether they are gender affected or not. The IF may consider one event to be gender affected, and to have a different gender eligibility policy for that event than for others. For example, International Orienteering Federation (IOF) considers Foot Orienteering, Mountain Bike Orienteering and Ski Orienteering to be gender affected and has developed a gender eligibility/transgender policy for those disciplines. The IOF does not consider Trail Orienteering (TrailO) to be gender affected, and thus that discipline is not subject to the gender eligibility/transgender policy. 3 – YES, general: this means that the IF considers all events/disciplines/categories of the sport they govern to be gender affected. | | |
